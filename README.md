# Password Strength Checker with Security Recommendations
A simple yet effective tool built in Python to assess the strength of user passwords and provide actionable security recommendations. This project helps promote better password hygiene by analyzing five key criteria: length, case sensitivity, numbers, and special characters.

# Features
Password Strength Evaluation: Classifies passwords as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
Security Recommendations: Suggests improvements to strengthen passwords.
Configurable Settings: Adjustable minimum password length for flexibility.
User-Friendly CLI: Interactive interface for password input and strength assessment.

# How It Works
The password is evaluated based on:

Minimum length (default: 8 characters)
Use of lowercase and uppercase letters
Presence of numeric digits
Inclusion of special characters
Based on these criteria, a score between 0 to 5 is generated, categorizing the password as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
